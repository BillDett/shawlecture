# Appliances V1

As a first step, We use a single class to represent all appliances in our house.

This is simple to understand, but has a few limitations. Each kind of appliance has different attributes and behaviors. So we either end up with an Appliance class that is very small and doesn't do what we want, or very big that has lots of extra things that aren't used for each kind of Appliance.

How can we do better?
